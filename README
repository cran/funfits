This is a port of the FUNFITS package (version 2.0) for SPlus by D. Nychka 
and others, see README.orig or 

	http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/~nychka/funfits/index.html

for details.

This port is at an early stage and covers only parts, because FUNFITS is a 
very huge library. Especially it will only compile with f77 (I'm using g77),
there is no f2c version at this time. It is easy to to this conversion
with f2c, but afterwards you have to create many header files, especially
for the GCVPACK routines. 

Details of what is ported and what not can be found in PORT-STATUS. 
(but "ported" does not mean "tested" in every case!) 

What should already work? 

"nnreg", "addreg", "tps", "tpsreg", "krig" -- but not all methods for objects 
created by these functions are working, some are missing.

All help pages are converted with Sd2Rd, even those of non ported functions.

Hopefully I will finish this port in the near future (and switch to 
FUNFITS version 2.1).

PS:
Some plot functions use interp(), so you'll need the "akima" library.
